Elstat OAI Server
=================

This is an example project that uses the
[Enhanced OAI server](https://github.com/EKT/EnhancedOAIServer) that
was developed by the National Documentation Centre [EKT](http://www.ekt.gr).

It has data in mods and uses an xlst to transform them to oai_dc if
this metadata prefix is requested.

It is a complete project that serves to show what needs to be
implemented in order to have a working enhanced oai server.
